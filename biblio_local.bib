              between the measured data and the predicted data is minimized.
              These algorithms are all based on a source type of integral
              representation of the scattered field, where the integral
              operator acts on a contrast source, being the product of the
              interior field and the contrast of the scattering object. Special
              attention is paid to the development of the
              contrast-source-inversion method, where the contrast sources are
              updated iteratively, and where, in each iteration, an explicit
              minimizer for the contrast is obtained. In particular, we discuss
              the effective implementation of a multiplicative constraint that
              minimizes the spatial variations of the contrast. We present
              actual reconstructions from both synthetic and experimental

                 requirement in using these approaches is evaluating the

              seismic data interpretation. This algorithm inverts all frequency
              data components simultaneously. A data-weighting scheme balances
              the contributions from different frequency data components so the
              inversion process does not become dominated by high-frequency
              data components, which produce a velocity image with many
              artifacts. A Gauss-Newton minimization approach achieves a high
              convergence rate and an accurate reconstructed velocity image. By
              introducing a modified adjoint formulation, we can calculate the
              Jacobian matrix efficiently, allowing the material properties in
              the perfectly matched layers (PMLs) to be updated automatically
              during the inversion process. This feature ensures the correct
              behavior of the inversion and implies that the algorithm is
              appropriate for realistic applications where a priori information
              of the background medium is unavailable. Two different
              regularization schemes, an L2 -norm and a weighted L2 -norm
              function, are used in this algorithm for smooth profiles and
              profiles with sharp boundaries, respectively. The regularization
              parameter is determined automatically and adaptively by the
              so-called multiplicative regularization technique. To test the

              velocity model using synthetic data generated by the
              finite-difference time-domain code. These numerical simulation

  abstract = "In this work, we successfully applied an alternative formulation
              of the perfectly matched layer (PML), the so-called nearly PML
              (NPML), to acoustic wave propagation modeling. The NPML
              formulation shows great advantages over the standard complex
              stretched coordinate PML. The NPML formulation deviates from the
              standard PML through an inexact variable change, but this fact
              only affects the wave behavior in the NPML layer, which is
              outside the region of interest. The equivalence of the
              wave-absorbing performance between these two PML formulations
              (the standard complex stretched coordinate PML formulation and
              the NPML formulation) in 3D Cartesian coordinates for acoustic
              wave propagation modeling is proved mathematically in this work.
              In time-domain methods, the advantages of the NPML over the
              standard PML were explained by both the analytical analysis and
              the numerical simulations in terms of implementation simplicity
              and computational efficiency. The computation time saving is up
              to 17\% for the 2D example used in this work. For 3D problems,
              this computational saving is more significant. After
              theoretically analyzing the numerical reflections from the NPML
              and the standard PML, we concluded that these two PML
              formulations have exactly the same performance, even after
              spatial discretization. This conclusion is validated by numerical
              experiment. Finally, we tested the NPML in the Marmousi velocity
              model and found its wave-absorbing rate is high enough, even for
              this realistic structure.",

                 approach for solving the inverse scattering problem for
                 ultrasound tomographic imaging. This method alternates between
                 solving the inverse scattering problem for the scattering
                 function and the forward scattering problem for the total
                 field and the inhomogeneous Green's function. The algorithm is
                 initialized using the basic Born inverse solution. One
                 fundamental problem is the algorithm diverges for strongly
                 scattering media. This is caused by the limitation of the Born
                 assumption in estimating the initial step of the algorithm. We
                 present a multiple frequency DBI approach to alleviate this
                 problem, thus extending the applicability of the DBI method to
                 the level of dealing with biological tissue. In this multiple
                 frequency approach, a low frequency DBI-based solution, is
                 used to initialize the algorithm at higher frequencies. The
                 low frequency allows convergence of the algorithm to a
                 contrast level that is close to the true level, however, with
                 a poor spatial resolution. The high frequency improves the
                 spatial resolution while preserving convergence because the
                 difference between the true contrast and the initial contrast
                 is relatively small. We present numerical simulations that

                 frequencies around 1 GHz) has mostly remained at the research
                 level for the past decade, gaining little clinical acceptance.
                 The major hurdles limiting patient use are both at the
                 hardware level (challenges in collecting accurate and
                 noncorrupted data) and software level (often plagued by
                 unrealistic reconstruction times in the tens of hours). In
                 this paper we report improvements that address both issues.
                 First, the hardware is able to measure signals down to levels
                 compatible with sub-centimeter image resolution while keeping
                 an exam time under 2 min. Second, the software overcomes the
                 enormous time burden and produces similarly accurate images in
                 less than 20 min. The combination of the new hardware and
                 software allows us to produce and report here the first
                 clinical 3-D microwave tomographic images of the breast. Two
                 clinical examples are selected out of 400+ exams conducted at
                 the Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical Center (Lebanon, NH). The
                 first example demonstrates the potential usefulness of our

              collected data from both the Fresnel and UPC Barcelona data sets.
              All inversion results are blind, but appropriate physical values

              to test the algorithms vary widely in terms of the background

              that the comparison is replicable, an automatic regularization

                 potentially very important advance over 2D techniques because
                 it eliminates associated approximations which may lead to more
                 accurate images. However, with the significant increase in
                 problem size, computational efficiency is critical to making
                 3D microwave imaging viable in practice. In this paper, we
                 present two 3D image reconstruction methods utilizing 3D
                 scalar and vector field modeling strategies, respectively.
                 Finite element (FE) and finite-difference time-domain (FDTD)
                 algorithms are used to model the electromagnetic field
                 interactions in human tissue in 3D. Image reconstruction
                 techniques previously developed for the 2D problem, such as
                 the dual-mesh scheme, iterative block solver, and adjoint
                 Jacobian method are extended directly to 3D reconstructions.
                 Speed improvements achieved by setting an initial field
                 distribution and utilizing an alternating-direction implicit
                 (ADI) FDTD are explored for 3D vector field modeling. The

                 correctly recovered the position, size and electrical
                 properties of the target. The adjoint formulation and the FDTD
                 method utilizing initial field estimates are found to be
                 significantly more effective in reducing the computation time.
                 Finally, these results also demonstrate that cross-plane

              presented for microwave tomographic imaging in medical

              to improve the efficiency of the iterative reconstruction process
              with apparently limited reduction in accuracy. In addition, the
              image recovery has been restricted to 2-D but is generalizable to

              effects are reduced when compared with results from an entirely

              based on the moment method and on the utilization of redundant
              data (i.e., the values of the components of the scattered
              electric field measured outside the investigation volume) in
              order to strictly constrain the solution. In particular, a
              multi-illumination-angle multiview approach is proposed, which is
              based on an integrodifferential formulation of the
              three-dimensional inverse electromagnetic scattering problem. The
              analytical model is discretized using the moment method, and a
              regularization procedure is employed to find a solution, in a
              least-squares sense, to the resulting rectangular ill-conditioned
              linear system of algebraic equations. Since the heaviest
              computations can be performed off line, the computer resources
              required by the approach are entirely independent of the number
              of views. Numerical simulations have been performed to assess the
              effectiveness of the approach in dielectric reconstruction, in
              particular, by evaluating the distortions due to the

              However, unlike the nonlinear conjugate gradient method and the

              reconstructing the unknown material properties of inhomogeneous
              objects embedded in a known inhomogeneous background medium.
              Unlike the CSI method using the integral equation (IE) approach,
              the FD-CSI method can readily employ an arbitrary inhomogeneous
              medium as its background. The ability to use an inhomogeneous
              background medium has made this algorithm very suitable to be
              used in through-wall imaging and time-lapse inversion
              applications. Similar to the IE-CSI algorithm the unknown
              contrast sources and contrast function are updated alternately to
              reconstruct the unknown objects without requiring the solution of
              the full forward problem at each iteration step in the
              optimization process. The FD solver is formulated in the
              frequency domain and it is equipped with a perfectly matched
              layer (PML) absorbing boundary condition. The FD operator used in
              the FD-CSI method is only dependent on the background medium and
              the frequency of operation, thus it does not change throughout
              the inversion process. Therefore, at least for the
              two-dimensional (2D) configurations, where the size of the
              stiffness matrix is manageable, the FD stiffness matrix can be
              inverted using a non-iterative inversion matrix approach such as
              a Gauss elimination method for the sparse matrix. In this case,
              an LU decomposition needs to be done only once and can then be
              reused for multiple source positions and in successive iterations
              of the inversion. Numerical experiments show that this FD-CSI

                 using a vector integral equation. As is well-known, this

              the scattered field due to the illumination of the objects by a
              set of known single-frequency wave fields. We present two inverse
              scattering methods that approximately recast the full nonlinear
              inversion into a number of linear inversion steps. The two
              methods are as computationally efficient as the constrained Born
              inversion but provide reconstruction results that are far
              superior and are almost comparable in quality to the ones
              obtained using a full nonlinear iterative inversion. The linear
              inversion steps follow what is referred to as the source-type
              integral equation approach in which the contrast sources are
              inverted for in the first step from the linear data equation. In
              this step, we employ a local (diagonal) approximation of the
              operator that relates the contrast sources to the incident field.
              Once the contrast sources have been determined, the total
              internal wave fields follow from a direct application of the
              object equation. In the third and final step, the contrast

              contrast source inversion method is applied to microwave

              and avoids solving any forward problem in each iterative step. In
              this way, the inverse scattering problem can efficiently be
              solved. Moreover, the recently developed multiplicative
              regularizer allows us to apply the method blindly to experimental
              data. We demonstrate inversion from experimental data collected
              by a 2.33-GHz circular microwave scanner using a two-dimensional
              (2-D) TM polarization measurement setup. Further some results of

                 from measured scattered field data. The main drawback is the
                 presence of an artificial weighting parameter in the cost
                 functional, which can only be determined through considerable
                 experimentation Therefore, we introduce the total variation as
                 a multiplicative constraint. Numerical examples demonstrate
                 that the algorithm based on this multiplicative regularization
                 seems to be robust and handling noisy data very well without
                 the necessity of the weighting parameter.",

  abstract = "Cross-well induction logging as known in the oil industry is a
              method for determining the electrical conductivity distribution
              between boreholes from the low-frequency electromagnetic field
              measurements in the boreholes. The authors discuss the
              reconstructions of the three-dimensional (3D) conductivity
              distribution using the contrast source inversion (CSI) method. In
              order to improve the reconstruction results, the concept of the
              extended Born approximation has been used to arrive at a
              preconditioning operator. Results of a number of numerical
              examples show that by using this preconditioning operator, a
              large conductivity contrast of the unknown objects (factor of
              100) can be reconstructed up to an acceptable degree of accuracy.
              Moreover, in each iteration, the computational effort to generate
              the preconditioning operator is negligible",
